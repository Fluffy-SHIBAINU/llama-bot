# 🦙 Llama Bot – Playful Local Chatbot with Personality

Llama Bot is a funny, character-based local AI chatbot powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and React.  
It includes agent presets like a silly llama, professor, coder, or joker — all running locally with models like `mistral`, `phi`, or `llama2`.
